synopsis: "A Coq library for *Principia Mathematica*'s propositional logic" # One-line description
description: """
  This package checks all of *Principia*'s primitive axioms, inference rules, and definitions
  against Coq's standard classical logic libraries; it also contains proofs that match the 
  proof sketches given in *Principia* in that (a) the proofs cite every proof mentioned in 
  *Principia*'s proof sketch and (b) nothing extraneous to *Principia*'s logic is used.
